# GNOME AppIndicator bridge for RadioTray-NG

RadioTray-NG's `DirectSni` backend deliberately exports a tiny DBusMenu object because the GNOME AppIndicator extension requires both an indicator ID and a menu path before it considers a StatusNotifierItem ready.

RadioTray-NG does **not** want GNOME Shell to render that DBusMenu. Its real menu is the native GTK menu built by `AppindicatorGui`, because that preserves the existing station artwork and GTK layout. Stock GNOME AppIndicator click handling opens the DBusMenu on primary/right click, so the shim appears as an empty grey popup before RadioTray-NG opens its own menu.

The DBusMenu bridge item is therefore exported as **hidden**. GNOME Shell still counts it for `numMenuItems`, so primary-click can open the DBusMenu root and deliver the root `opened` event, but there is no visible Shell menu row to draw behind the native GTK popup.

`DirectSni` intentionally does **not** export `StatusNotifierItem.Activate`. Current GNOME AppIndicator detects that and treats RadioTray-NG as menu-only, so a primary click opens the DBusMenu immediately instead of waiting for a possible double-click activation. The hidden root bridge then opens the native GTK menu on the first click. This provides a source-level single-click fallback even when the extension-side click bridge is not taking effect.

Run:

```bash
./extras/gnome-appindicator/fix-radiotray-appindicator.sh
```

The helper modifies only the `radiotray-ng` indicator path in the user's copy of `indicatorStatusIcon.js`. It routes primary, middle and secondary clicks to `SecondaryActivate(x, y)`. Other indicators continue through the extension's original handler unchanged.

On GNOME Wayland, log out and back in once after applying the patch.

The helper never edits `/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions` directly. If the AppIndicator extension is installed system-wide, it creates a per-user copy first and patches that copy.

The helper is idempotent: if the RadioTray marker is already present it exits without modifying the extension again. It keeps timestamped backups under the per-user extension directory before changing JavaScript.
